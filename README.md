# Deep-Neural-Network-Basics
Based on DeepLearning.AI Neural Networks course's assessments

Implements a Deep Neural Network of 4 layers (from scratch) which is used for binary classificiation of images

Uses multiple helper functions to implement forward propagation and backward propagation

Note:

-- Classifies images as Cat or Non-cat

-- Uses an image dataset in an h5 format
